This repo contains the necessery csv files and a jupyter notebook in which data visualization 
of pakistan covid19 cases is being showed , you can extend the features and add work according to your need.
Dataset is taken from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/pakistan-corona-virus-citywise-data, so you will be needing to update the dataset csv file to see latest results.
the code is totally generic and fully commented nearly each line which explains the functionality
Just plug and play notebook ,and can be used for your own purposes
REMEMBER TO DOWNLOAD ALL EXCEL FILES SO THE CODE CAN GET LINK TO READ THOSE FILES
thank you
